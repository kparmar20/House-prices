# House-prices
Model for predicting London house prices

Basic usage of several models.   House Price Project 1.ipynb can be ignored as that was me just trying to figure out the basics.

Steps:
1. Download csv price data (see under 'Requirements')
2. Execute House Price Project 2.ipynb
3. Execute whichever model you require

Requirements:
You will need to download the UK house prices data directly from HM Land registry:
